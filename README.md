###Pizza Menu
This is a simple form that collected pizza size and topping input from the user
and then calculates the price of the ordered pizza.

###Tic Tac Toe
This is the classic Tic Tac Toe game using fun replacements for the traditional X and O
that allows the user to play against the computer.

###Calculator
This is a simple calculator that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
